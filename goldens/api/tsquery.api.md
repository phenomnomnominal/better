export function tsquery(query: string, issueMessage?: string): BettererFileTest;

// Warnings were encountered during analysis:
//
// /Users/craigspence/Dev/betterer/node_modules/@types/node/globals.d.ts:72:13 - (TS2403) Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type.  Variable 'AbortSignal' must be of type '{ new (): AbortSignal; prototype: AbortSignal; abort(reason?: any): AbortSignal; timeout(milliseconds: number): AbortSignal; }', but here has type '{ new (): AbortSignal; prototype: AbortSignal; }'.
