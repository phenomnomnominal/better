# Betterer VS Code

Are you working with a large team, or a legacy codebase? Want to make big sweeping changes over your project, but can't do it all in one go?

Betterer makes it easier to make incremental improvements to your codebase!

## Features

[**Betterer**](https://github.com/phenomnomnominal/betterer) runs entirely in its own world, so the usual **ESLint** or **TypeScript** extensions can't report the issues. But everyone loves seeing red squiggly lines in the code editor, so **Betterer** now has [its very own VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Betterer.betterer-vscode) ðŸ¤¯!

### Initialise in a new project

You can run the `betterer.init` command in a project! It will generate config files and update your `package.json` with scripts and dependencies:

### See all issues in a file

And when you've got some tests setup, it will show you all the existing issues in a file, and when they were first created. And it will show you any new issues as you make them:

I reckon that's pretty sweet!
