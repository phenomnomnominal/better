 *
 * @remarks The internal implementation of `BettererSuite` is responsible for a lot more than
 * this interface suggests, but we want to minimise the public API surface as much as possible.
 * You can get the `BettererSuite` via the {@link @betterer/betterer#BettererReporter | `BettererReporter` }
 * interface.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const myReporter: BettererReporter = {
 *   // Access the suite before any tests are run:
 *   suiteStart (suite: BettererSuite) {
 *     // ...
 *   },
 *   // Access the suite when something goes wrong:
 *   suiteError (suite: BettererSuite) {
 *     // ...
